    <h2>Susan Harvey</h2>
    <p>Hello. I currently live in Michigan. Fall is glorious here and is my favorite season. I love apple orchards and pumpkin patches, the changing leaves, warm days, and cool nights. Fall is perfect bonfire weather.</p> 
    <p>I have 5 amazing children and 11 adorable grandchildren. I visit them as often as possible.</p> 
    <p>I am going back to school after a 35 year hiatus to raise my family.
       I am not very computer savvy so I look forward to learning with and from you all. The computer and web programming classes are very challenging for me but I know this is a weakness I need to turn into a strength.</p>
    <p>I love my Savior, His gospel, the scriptures, my family, traveling, all things music, goats, and hiking.</p>
    <p>I am always happy to help my classmates when I can. If we help each other and rely on the Lord, I know we can all be successful.</p>
